Hello! Welcome to my food blog, College Cravings! I'm Kellie, and I'm a nerdy computer science student who is also a foodie at heart. This is my creative outlet, from the code of this website to the recipes that I'm sharing with you! 

I'm a food enthusiast who enjoys trying all kinds of recipes, but I also often find myself sticking to my Italian roots and loving to cook those meals the most. I'm also a huge chocolate fanatic (dark chocolate, anyone?), and I try to find any excuse to throw it into a dessert. 

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy! Happy cooking!
