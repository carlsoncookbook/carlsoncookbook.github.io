Call me basic, but I do enjoy a good avocado. 

That smooth, creamy, melt-in-your-mouth texture is perfect for a hot summer day. And what's better than turning avocados into guacamole? This is the way I like to do it, with juicy tomatoes and a little kick of heat, but all you really need is a ripe avocado and a pinch of salt. It's so simple, yet so delicious, perfect for a pick-me-up snack during exams or even just for a treat on weekends.

Yields: approx. 1.5 cups

Ingredients:
* 2 avocados, ripe and slightly soft to the touch
* 1 tablespoon lime juice
* 1 roma tomato, diced
* 1/4 medium red onion, diced finely
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 12 "dashes" chili powder
* 5 "dashes" cayenne pepper

Directions:
1. Cut the avocados in half. Remove the pit, and score the inside of each avocado half with a knife in a fine grid pattern. Scoop out the flesh with a spoon, and place into a bowl.
2. Add the lime juice, and mix/mash lightly with a fork. Don't overmash!
3. Add the tomato and red onion, and then mix again.
4. Add the salt, chili powder, and cayenne pepper. Stir again to combine and and create the prefectly smooth yet chunky texture.

Note: Adjust the spices to your personal preference! I like it with a little heat, but not too overwhelming.
