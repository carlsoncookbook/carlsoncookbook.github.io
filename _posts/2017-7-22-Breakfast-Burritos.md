title: Any-Time-of-Day Burritos
---

This recipe is very tasty, but I honestly like it most because of how easy it is. 

Using a communal kitchen in my dorm, I went from gathering ingredients from my room to fully cleaned up and having a hot meal in 20 minutes. They may technically be breakfast burritos because they're filled with fluffy scrambled eggs, but honestly they're delicious and filling for any meal of the day. I usually make these for a 2 p.m. brunch on the weekend -- they're great brain food in the middle of a long study session!

Servings: 2

Ingredients:
* 2 8-inch flour tortillas
* 1 tsp. olive oil
* 1/8 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
* 1 hot italian sausage, casing removed
* 2 eggs
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1/4 c. shredded cheese of your preference

Directions:
1. Heat the oil over medium heat in a medium frying pan.
2. When hot, add the onion, and saute until slightly translucent, about 2 minutes.
3. Lay out tortillas on a piece of foil.
4. Add the sausage, and cook until no longer pink. Continuously break up sausage pieces while cooking.
5. Evenly divide the sausage onion mixure onto the two tortillas, keeping the oil and other liquids in the pan. Return the pan to the burner.
6. Evenly divide the cheese, and sprinkle over the two tortillas.
7. Scramble the eggs with a splash of water in a separate bowl. Mix in salt and pepper to taste (Note: I use about 1/8 tsp. pepper and no salt, but it's up to you!).
8. Pour the eggs to the hot frying pan, and continuously fold and stir to make fluffy scrambled eggs.
9. When they're cooked to your liking, turn off heat, and evenly divide the eggs between the two burritos.
10. Fold and roll your burritos, and enjoy!

Note: I often wrap the burritos together in the foil, and then clean up any dishes before eating. They stay nice and warm together, and then there's nothing left to do but enjoy your tasty food afterwards!
