Ingredients:
* cooking spray
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup white sugar
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 egg 
* 1 1/4 cups milk
* 1/3 cup vegetable oil
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 3/4 cup mini chocolate chips

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly spray 48 miniature muffin cups.
2. Mix flour, white sugar, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
3. Lightly beat egg in a separate bowl; stir in milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Mix liquid mixture into flour mixture until incorporated. Fold in chocolate chips. Fill muffin cups 3/4 full with batter.
