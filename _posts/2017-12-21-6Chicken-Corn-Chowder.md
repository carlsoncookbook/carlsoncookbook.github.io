Yields: 6 servings

Ingredients:
* 2 chicken breasts
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 1 lb yukon gold potato, diced into small cubes
* 3 cups sweet corn kernels
* 1⁄2 cup onion, diced finely
* 1⁄4 cup red bell pepper, diced
* 1/4 cup carrots, diced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 tablespoon oil
* 2 cup chicken stock

* 1 tablespoon hot sauce

Directions:
1. Add the butter and oil to a cast iron pot over medium low heat. 
2. Dice the chicken into small cubes, and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.
3. Saute the onion until slightly translucent. Then add the red bell pepper and the carrots. Cook until slightly soft, about 2 minutes. 
4. Add the chicken to the pot, and nearly cook through.
5. Add the diced potatoes, season with salt and pepper as desired, and stir to combine. Saute for 2 mintues. 
6. Pour in the chicken stock, milk, and cream. Stir to combine, and then add the corn kernels. Simmer over low heat for about 20 minutes.
7. If a thicker consistency is desired, add a tempered cornstarch and chicken broth slurry, one tablespoon at a time. 
8. Add the hot sauce 5 minutes before serving. Garnish with parsley.
