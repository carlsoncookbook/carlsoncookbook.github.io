The best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted. But where does the name come from, you ask? 

This recipe is heavily adapted from a "Star Wars" cookbook my family has had for years where cheesy puns run rampant. Slowly we tweaked and adjusted the recipe until I ended up with this. The buttery vanilla dough steals the show, and for a chocolate lover like me, that's extremely high praise. If you're like me at all, you'll find yourself unable to resist the call of your cookies (or the call of this recipe once you've eaten them all).

Yields: Approximatly 27 cookies

Ingredients:
* 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour, sifted
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 1/2 cup granulated white sugar
* 1 cup packed light brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* 2 large eggs
* 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chunks
* 2/3 cup milk chocolate chips
* 1/3 cup miniature white chocolate chips

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. 
2. In a medium mixing bowl, gently combine the sifted flour, baking soda, and salt.
3. In a separate large mixing bowl, cube the butter. Beat with an electric mixer at high speed until creamy, about 30 seconds.
4. Add the white sugar and the brown sugar to the butter, and beat with the electric mixer again for about 3 minutes, until creamy and about doubled in size.
5. Gently fold the eggs and the vanilla into the sugar butter mixture. Beat with the electric mixture until creamy again, about 1 minute.
6. Using a spatula, fold in 1/3 of the dry mixture into the wet. Once combined add the next third and repeat until no flour mixture remains. The dough should be slightly wet but not overwhelmingly sticky. Add a little more flour if necessary.
7. Add the chocolate and stir to combine. 
8. Roll the cookie dough into approximately 27 cookies and place on large trays. (I find that 9 per cookie sheet works well.)
9. Refrigerate the dough balls for 15 minutes, and then bake for 9-10 minutes or until golden brown.
10. Eat and enjoy!
