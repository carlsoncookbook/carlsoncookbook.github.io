title: Strawberry Lemon Trifle
---

Simple, simple, simple, simple. Why? 

The beautiful, irresistable layers consist of only 4 ingredients. But that's not to be mistaken for a boring dessert. The rich red, yellow, and white layers melt together with each bite. It's creamy yet light, and it won't weigh you down at the end of the meal. This strawberry lemon trifle is the perfect capstone to any holiday, or any day you'd like to make a holiday.

Servings: 16 (approximately)

Ingredients:
* 1 16 oz. carton of fresh strawberries
* 3 cups lemon pudding (Note: I use Jello lemon pudding mix and make it with whole milk)
* 16 oz. lite Cool Whip
* 1 Angel Food cake, prepared

Directions:
1. Cube the angel food cake. Set aside.
2. Wash, hull, and slice the strawberries. Set aside.
3. Estimate the number of layers you want based on your trifle dish, and divide your ingredients up into this many portions. 3-4 usually works well!
4. Put a thin spread of lemon pudding at the bottom of the dish, and then start layering! Begin with the cubed angel food cake, follow with the Cool Whip, strawberries, and then lemon pudding. Continue to fill the container, layer by layer, stopping with a top layer of Cool Whip and strawberries. Make sure to arrange the strawberries decoratively on top!

Note: Concerning the trifle dish, I only had a large mixing bowl at school with me. It works perfectly well, but I'd recommend a transparent container -- it makes everyone's mouths water before they take a scoop!
