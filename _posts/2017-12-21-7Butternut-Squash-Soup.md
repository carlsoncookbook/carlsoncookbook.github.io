Yields: 6 servings

Ingredients:
* One 2- to 3-pound butternut squash, peeled and seeded
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 6 cups chicken stock
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* Nutmeg (optional)
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 1 tablespoon chicken stock

Directions:
1. Cut squash into 1-inch chunks. 
2. In a large pot melt butter. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 8 minutes. 
3. Add the squash and the stock. Bring to a simmer and cook until squash is tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. 
4. Remove squash chunks with slotted spoon and place in a blender and puree. 
5. Return blended squash to pot. Stir and season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. 
6. If a thicker soup is desired, mix cornstarch with 1 tablespoon chicken stock until completely combined. Slowly temper the mixture by adding a few spoonfuls of hot soup and stirring. Add this mixture back to the soup, and mix well. Let simmer for 10 minutes before serving.
