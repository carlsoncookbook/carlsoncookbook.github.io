A healthier version of my favorite Chinese fried rice, but it's no less delicious. Swap salt and msg for crisp veggies and spicy mustard to create a dish that you can't stop digging into.

This dish is a staple for me at school, as it's an easy stir fry dish that I can make ahead of time, or easily double for a meal with friends.
