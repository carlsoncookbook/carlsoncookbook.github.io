Yields: approximately 20 appetizers

Ingredients: 
* 2 (12 ounce) packages refrigerated biscuit dough 
* 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened 
* 1 (6 ounce) can crab meat, drained 
* 2 tablespoons mayonnaise 
* 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
* 2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion 
* 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
* 1 pinch paprika 

Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease 12 tartlet pans.
2. Divide rolls in half and press into the prepared tartlet pans. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, combine cream cheese, crab, mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, Cheddar cheese, green onions and Worcestershire sauce. Spoon 1 teaspoon of mixture into tarts and garnish with paprika.
4. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15 to 20 minutes, or until light brown. These freeze wonderfully. Just reheat before serving.
