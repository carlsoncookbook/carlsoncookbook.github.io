<p style="float:center; font-size: 9pt; text-align: center; width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><img src="https://github.com/carlsonkellie/College-Cravings/blob/master/images/pesto2.jpg?raw=true">Perfect topping for anything from chicken to bruschetta <br><br></p>

<br>


Yields: approx. 1 cup

Ingredients:
* 2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed
* 1/2 cup freshly grated Romano or Parmesan-Reggiano cheese
* 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1/3 cup pine nuts
* 3 cloves garlic, minced finely
* Salt, to taste
* Black pepper, to taste

Directions:
1. Place the basil leaves and pine nuts into the bowl of a food processor and pulse a several times.
2. Add the garlic and Parmesan or Romano cheese and pulse several times more. Scrape down the sides of the food processor with a rubber spatula.
3. While the food processor is running, slowly add the olive oil in a steady small stream. Adding the olive oil slowly, while the processor is running, will help it emulsify and help keep the olive oil from separating. Occasionally stop to scrape down the sides of the food processor.
4. Mix in the salt and black pepper to taste.

Note: Toss with pasta for a quick sauce, dollop over baked chicken, or spread onto crackers or toasted slices of bread.
