Welcome to my blog, College Cravings! 

I'm Kellie, a nerdy computer science student who loves to experiment with food and express my creativity in the kitchen. I put together this website in one weekend, so I'm excited to see it where it will go from here!

I hope to fill this website predominantly with a collection of college student friendly recipes (and mouth watering photographs of said food), but also with some dishes that I enjoy making at home. I'm not a professional, but I am an avid watcher of Buzzfeed Food videos. I have fun with it and I hope you will too!
