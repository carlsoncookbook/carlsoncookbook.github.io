title: Chicken Marsala
---

A traditional dish, simplified. I'm always up for delicious and quick food. 

But for this recipe, you don't even need much to serve it - a bowl, a fork, and you're good to go. What else is there to want in a meal when you have chicken - that you can pull apart with your fork - smothered in buttery mushrooms and a luscious marsala wine sauce? Nothing comes to my mind.

Servings: 3-6 (depending on how hungry you are!)

Ingredients:
* 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/2 cup cornstarch
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
* 1 medium yellow onion, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, diced
* 12 ounces baby bella mushrooms, quartered
* 1 tablespoon dried parsley
* 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
* 1 cup chicken stock
* 1/2 cup Marsala wine
* 4 tablespoons water

Directions:
1. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and then lightly coat in the cornstarch. Set aside remaining cornstarch.
2. Press ‘Chicken/Meat’ to preheat the pressure cooker. As it heats up, add half of the oil, and then half the chicken. Lightly sear the chicken (less than a minute per side), and then remove from the pressure cooker pot. Add the rest of the oil, and repeat with remaining chicken.
3. Add the butter, and then the onions, garlic, and mushrooms. Season with the parsley and red pepper. Cook for 2-3 minutes.
4. Slowly mix the remaining cornstarch with the water, 1 tablespoon at a time, just until it is fully combined and a slurry has been formed.
5. Return chicken to the pressure cooker, and pour in the stock and wine. While stirring, add the corn starch slurry, and then seal the lid. Adjust the time to 9 minutes
6. At the end of the cooking time, quick release the pressure. Serve and enjoy!

Note: I enjoy this over pasta and peas, topped with parmesan cheese, but it's also delicious with rice or just on its own!
