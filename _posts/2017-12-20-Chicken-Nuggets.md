Servings: 4

Ingredients:
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 tablespoon seasoned salt 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 large eggs 
* 2 cup seasoned breadcrumbs 
* 2 chicken breasts, cut into 1 inch pieces 
* Vegetable oil, for frying

Dip:
* 1/3 Cup Pasta Sauce
* 1/3 Cup Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
* 1/8 Cup Grated Parmesan Cheese
* 1/4 Teaspoon Chopped Garlic
* 1/8 Teaspoon Basil
* 1/8 Teaspoon Oregano

Dip Topping: 
* 1 Teaspoon Bread Crumbs
* 1 Teaspoon Grated Parmesan Cheese
* 1 Tablespoon Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
* Pinch of Basil and Oregano for garnish

Directions:
1. First make the dip. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. In a bowl mix together pasta sauce, mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, garlic, basic, and oregano.
3. Spoon mixture into an oven safe dish and sprinkle with topping ingredients.
4. Bake for 15-20 minutes covered with tinfoil, make sure the tinfoil isn't touching the cheese if possible.
5. While the dip is baking, make the chicken nuggets. 
6. In a plastic bag, mix the flour, seasoned salt and some salt and pepper.
7. In a small bowl, mix the eggs with 2 tablespoons water. 
8. In a separate bowl, add the breadcrumbs.
9. Shake the chicken pieces in the bag to coat. 
10. In batches, dip the chicken in the egg wash, then in the breadcrumbs.
11. Heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat (it's ready when a bread crust dipped in the oil starts to sizzle immediately). Fry the chicken, in batches if needed, until golden brown and cooked through, a couple minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel.
12. Remove the dip from the oven and let cool before serving. If desired, remove the tinfoil and brown top by cooking longer.
